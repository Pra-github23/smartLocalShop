What I’ve Achieved in 20 Days on Smart Local Visit Project 🚀
Over the last 20 days, I’ve been working on an exciting project — Smart Local Visit — a platform designed to help customers easily browse local shops and find the products they need, all while saving valuable time. 🕒💡

Here’s a quick rundown of some of the key features I've added:

Rewards System: Customers can now earn rewards based on their purchases, and use those points to save on future orders. Every 50 rupees spent gives you 1 reward point, and 10 points equal 1 rupee off your next purchase! 🎉💰

Buy Now, Pick Up Later: One of my favorite features, which allows users to buy products online and pick them up later from the store. This helps save time and avoid the hassle of waiting for deliveries — perfect for busy schedules! 🛒⏳

Local Shop Inventory View: The website displays local shop inventories, showing not only which products are available, but also the quantity. This feature helps users plan their shopping trips more efficiently and saves time spent searching in stores. 🏪📦

This project has been a great learning experience, combining user experience and e-commerce functionality to bring convenience to local shopping. I’m proud to have contributed to creating a more efficient shopping experience, and I can’t wait to see how this platform helps users in their day-to-day lives!
